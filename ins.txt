For the selection for the next round here is a task for you to create a user management system.

Create a course website where there are two types of users

Every new user will register as a student or teacher
Teachers can create new courses 
the course will have its page with 
course name 
course description 
teacher name 
a button to join the course
Teachers can see how many students joined their course
Student can join the course 
 They can view the list of all courses

At last you have to host this task to firebase.
